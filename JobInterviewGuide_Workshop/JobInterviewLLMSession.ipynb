    "The workshop notebooks cover a steady progression from basic data handling to more advanced machine learning models. We start with **Data Stream Visualization**, which sets up the foundation for continuous data plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we move into parametric models with **Linear Regression**. Here, evaluating the model is just as important as training it. We look at residuals (the errors) to ensure they are homoscedastic (constant variance) and normally distributed. We also evaluate the models using R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification, **Logistic Regression** is our core focus. We interpret log-odds through coefficients and the sigmoid function, and replace MSE with **Cross-Entropy (Log-Loss)** as our primary optimization metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving to non-parametric models, we explore **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**. We test different hyperparameter configurations, looking closely at how the number of neighbors ($k$) and different distance metrics impact model bias and variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, **Decision Trees** help us understand non-linear, tree-based splits. Visualizing the tree and its leaf nodes allows us to easily explain predictions, while tweaking the maximum depth helps prevent overfitting to noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across all these algorithms, rigorous experimental design is key. This means understanding exactly what makes a model **supervised** vs **unsupervised**, and using clean **Train/Validation/Test Splits**. Most importantly, we protect against **Data Leakage** by strictly scaling data inside of a Scikit-Learn `Pipeline`, ensuring test data statistics never bleed into training data."

You incorrectly identified the consequence of standardizing data before splitting as a \"Hyperparameter Misconfiguration\". The correct answer is **Data Leakage**. By fitting a scaler on the *entire* dataset before splitting, information about the validation and test sets (specifically global means and standard deviations) \"leaks\" into the training pipeline. This gives the model an unfair advantage during evaluation because it has indirectly \"seen\" statistical properties of the unseen data, leading to artificially inflated performance metrics that will drop when deployed in the real world. To fix this, you must construct a `Pipeline` that isolates the `fit` step of the scaling process to *only* the training folds during cross-validation.\n",

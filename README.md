## Repository Contents
- `JobInterviewLLMSession.ipynb`: A generated Markdown Jupyter Notebook that simulates an interactive technical and behavioral interview with an LLM interviewer. It covers 15 technical assessment questions, evaluations, and a final scoring based on machine learning concepts spanning regression, classification, trees, and proper validation methodologies.
- `JobInterviewGuide_Workshop.ipynb`: The primary workshop notebook, updated to document quiz success metrics, reflect on missed questions (specifically data leakage), and contain completed, PEP8-compliant Python practices. Examples include demonstrating Data Leakage patterns, plotting Linear Residuals with `seaborn`, and scanning KNN Hyperparameters.

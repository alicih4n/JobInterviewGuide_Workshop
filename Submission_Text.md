**Executive Summary:**
We simulated a 15-question technical interview using an LLM to assess fundamental machine learning concepts spanning linear vs. logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and model evaluation metrics. During the interactive session, we identified a knowledge gap in Data Leakage, specifically incorrectly scaling entire datasets prior to validation splitting. To address this, we implemented targeted Python exercises to reinforce robust cross-validation pipelines utilizing `scikit-learn`. Additionally, we successfully completed programmatic residual analysis and hyperparameter tuning sweeps. Finally, we documented our reflection on the importance of enforcing strict preprocessing boundaries and refined our repository with clean, PEP8-compliant code ready for final assessment.
